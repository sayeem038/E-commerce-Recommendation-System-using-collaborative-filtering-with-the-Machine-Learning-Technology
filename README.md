# Abstract :-  
E-commerce platforms are increasingly using machine learning to provide personalized shopping experiences to their users. By analyzing user preferences, purchase history, and browsing behavior, the system employs algorithms to predict and recommend products or items, optimizing the user experience. There are many e-commerce platforms that use different recommendation systems to suggest products to their customers. This research work intends to build one type of organized structure for a product recommendation system by using a collaborative filtering approach. By using the Collaborative Filtering System this proposed E-commerce-based Smart Recommendation employs Information Filtering to enhance user experience. This system recommends products based on userâ€™s purchases and searches. In the dynamic dominion of e-commerce products recommendation module will ensure an engaging interface, promoting user satisfaction and driving sales. The capabilities of collaborative filtering and its practical implementation has been showcased effectively in the outcome which will be a comprehensive and functional system for constructing a smart recommendation system.
